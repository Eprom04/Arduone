# Arduone
A new 8051 based development board

The aim of this real open source open hardware project is to challenge the ubiquitous Arduino, offering to the hobbyst the chance to really understand what he is doing. There is no pre-developed sketch, every "driver" for any external device must be developed from scratch.
